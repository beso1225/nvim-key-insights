# nvim-key-insights

[![CI](https://github.com/beso1225/nvim-key-insights/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/beso1225/nvim-key-insights/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Privacy-first Neovim usage collection and deterministic local analysis.

This repository is in its initial implementation phase. The intended system has three parts:

1. a Neovim 0.10+ Lua collector;
2. a local Rust analyzer that produces `summary.json` and `report.md`;
3. an optional Codex skill that reads only the sanitized summary.

Raw key logging, Insert-mode text, command/search text, and file paths are disabled by default. Terminal, prompt, special, and sensitive buffers are excluded from collection.

## Development

Enter the reproducible development shell and run the test suite:

```sh
nix develop
pkf run test
```

Individual tasks are available through `pkf list`.

```

## Status

The current implementation establishes privacy defaults, strict event construction, and a bounded streaming JSONL validator with session-aware validation. Input collection, deterministic reporting, and Codex integration will be implemented incrementally with TDD.
